# Student-Stress-Analysis-Prediction
This project aims to analyze factors influencing stress levels in students and to develop models that predict stress levels.
Some quesitons answered:

- What is the distribution of stress levels among students?
- Which factors have the biggest impact on stress?
- Which factors do students report having the most issues with?
- Is there any correlations between factors?
